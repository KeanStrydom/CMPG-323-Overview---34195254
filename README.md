# CMPG-323-Overview---34195254
This is the required repository for Project 1 of the CMPG 323 module. This repository will be a valuable asset throughout the semester, especially as a planning and guiding tool, to make sure that I stay on track.

## Repository Creation and Allocation
A repository will be created for each project throughout the semester. Each repository will be linked to the KanBan project created during Project 1 of CMPG 323. This means that the following repositories will be created:
  -CMPG 323 Overview - 34195254 (for Project 1)
  -CMPG 323 Project 2 - 34195254 (for Project 2)
  -CMPG 323 Project 3 - 34195254 (for Project 3)
  -CMPG 323 Project 4 - 34195254 (for Project 4)
  -CMPG 323 Project 5 - 34195254 (for Project 5)
  
Each project's source control will take place by use of its own repository but each repository will share the same Kanban Project. This means that I will be able to work in sprints and track my progress throughout the semester.

## Branching Strategy
I will have 2 branches in my repositories:
 -Main
 -Develop
The main branch will hold the final version of each project. The develop branch will be the branch that I will mostly be working in. THe final version(s) of each project will then be committed to the main branch. This will allow not only for source control, but version control as well.
  
## Use of a .gitignore file and the storage of Credentials and Sensitive information.
All credentials and sensitive information will be stored in a .json file, which will be stored inside the .gitignore file. This will ensure security by not allowing the sensitive information to be public in the repository on GitHub, which ensures that the public will not have access to the sensitive information.
